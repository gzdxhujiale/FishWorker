# Documents Module

## Scope

Documents owns node-bound Word-like detail documents powered by `@hufe921/canvas-editor`.

Current files:

- `KnowledgeDocumentWorkspace.tsx`: selected-node document loading, saving, toolbar, page navigation, importer entry, DOCX export, and inline AI panel.
- `canvasEditorAdapter.ts`: the only place that creates and controls the canvas editor instance.
- `knowledgeDocumentTypes.ts`: document snapshot, status, save input, command, and format-state types.
- `../mathInput/mathClipboard.ts`: shared ChatGPT/KaTeX/MathML/plain-text math paste normalization used before inserting into canvas-editor.
- `../mathInput/documentClipboard.ts`: shared ChatGPT/math-rich document paste normalization that turns headings, lists, separators, display math, and paragraphs into semantic blocks before the adapter writes canvas-editor elements.

## Boundaries

- Word documents bind only by `courseId + mindMapId + nodeId`.
- The workspace must not bind documents by title, path, or UI selection text.
- Renderer code must save through `window.aistudyKnowledgeDocuments` or the local snapshot fallback.
- `knowledge_documents` stores the current pointer and metadata only; actual content belongs to snapshots.
- A successful database save refreshes the IndexedDB recovery mirror, but the database remains authoritative.
- A successful database read with no node document opens an empty document and clears the old local mirror; local snapshots are only used when the document API or database read fails.
- Large images and attachments must not be stored as long inline base64 in document JSON.
- DOCX export is a read-only projection of the current node document snapshot; it must not mutate the editor snapshot or document binding.
- Column layout is currently block-level: the editor converts simple text documents into a 1-row canvas-editor table marked as `aistudyBlockKind: "columns"`. Content columns are split by full page inner width, with disabled spacer cells on both sides of each center divider so text does not touch the divider. Setting one column closes column layout by merging content cells in reading order while skipping spacer cells; switching between two and three columns first merges the existing column block and then redistributes the text. Complex non-column documents fall back to inserting an empty column block instead of rewriting tables or images. It is saved in the normal snapshot, reopens through the existing document loader, and exports to DOCX as content columns with only the internal divider. It is not a page/section-level flowing Word columns implementation.

## User Flow

1. User switches from the mind map to Word mode.
2. Mind-map changes flush first so the selected node exists in `mind_map_nodes`.
3. The document workspace loads the selected node document or creates an empty local snapshot.
4. Editor changes queue a debounced save.
5. Node switching, mode switching, and app close all flush pending document changes.
6. User can export the current node document as `.docx`; the main process owns file dialog and file writing.

## Extension Rules

- Add canvas-editor commands to the adapter handle before exposing them in UI.
- Keep document status loading lightweight; do not load every document snapshot for a course.
- Importers must produce a document snapshot and commit through the existing save path.
- Exporters must read from the active document snapshot and keep generated files outside MySQL.
- New asset handling must write to asset storage/link tables instead of embedding binaries.
- Math paste behavior must stay shared with textbook notes through `features/mathInput`; do not add document-only symbol replacements in this adapter.
- ChatGPT or webpage rich-text paste must not inherit external CSS spacing. Preserve semantic structure, then render with AIstudy document spacing and snapshot attributes.
- Changes to document DB-first recovery must keep `npm run qa:knowledge-reliability` passing.
